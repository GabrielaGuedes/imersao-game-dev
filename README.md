## About

This project was develop in [Imers√£o Game Dev from Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/imersao-gamedev-javascript).

I have develop in my local using the p5.js lib and Node (to create a localhost), instead of using the p5.js editor in the browser.

The game itself is finished, but I'm still currently refactoring it and then I will use others sprites/backgrounds/etc.
